![Tests](https://github.com/Attrup/PDF-Merge/actions/workflows/unit-tests.yml/badge.svg)

PDF-Merge is a simple and easy-to-use CLI tool for merging PDF files, created as part of learning the C# language. To use the tool, you must obtain a binary by either downloading the [latest release](https://github.com/Attrup/PDF-Merge/releases) or building it locally and add it to your system path. Follow the instructions under [Installation](#installation) to get started ðŸ™‚

## User Guide

Once added to the system path, the tool can be called from anywhere using:

```bash
pdf-merge <arguments>
```

### CLI Arguments

- `-d, --directory`  
  Merge all PDF files from a specified directory (sorted lexicographically before combining).
- `-f, --files`  
  Specify individual PDF file paths (accepts multiple file paths separated by spaces). Files are combined in the order they are listed.
- `-o, --output` (Default: `combined`)  
  Set the output file name (without file extension).
- `-v, --verbose` (Default: `false`)  
  Enable verbose output.
- `--help`  
  Display the help screen.

It is possible to specify both a directory and a list of files. In this case, all files from the directory will be merged first, followed by the specified files in the given order.

### Examples

#### Merge All PDF Files from a Directory  
Merge all PDFs in the current directory:

```bash
pdf-merge --directory . --output MergedFile
pdf-merge -d . -o MergedFile
```

Merge PDFs from another directory:

```bash
pdf-merge --directory ../../PDFSlides/Week_4 --output Week_4_Slides
pdf-merge -d ../../PDFSlides/Week_4 -o Week_4_Slides
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Note:** The output file will be saved in the directory where the command is executed.

#### Merge Selected PDF Files  
Merge specific files:

```bash
pdf-merge --files file1.pdf file2.pdf file3.pdf --output Week_1
pdf-merge -f file1.pdf file2.pdf file3.pdf -o Week_1
```

## Program Output

### Standard Output  
Without verbose mode, the tool provides minimal output:

```console
$ pdf-merge --directory . --output MergedFile
PDF-Merge
Merging PDF files   [####################] Done!
```

### Verbose Mode  
With verbose mode enabled, the tool provides detailed feedback:

```console
$ pdf-merge --directory PDFSlides/Week_1
PDF-Merge
